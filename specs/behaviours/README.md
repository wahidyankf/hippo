# Resource guard behaviours

These scenarios are shared by unit, local integration, and safe compiled-binary E2E adapters. Scenarios tagged `@e2e-exempt` require synthetic pressure, process mutation, or repository lifecycle access that is unsafe or incapable at the public host boundary. Repository configuration and artifact lifecycle scenarios also use `@unit-exempt` because they require real files or subprocesses; they remain mandatory in the integration adapter. The resource-guard test contract owns an exact approved exemption inventory with a reason for every exempt scenario, so a new, removed, renamed, or unknown exemption fails behavior compliance.
